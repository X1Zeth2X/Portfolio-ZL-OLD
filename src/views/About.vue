              exploration, reading through documentations then getting confused 
              and understanding it.

          <h3 class="subheading font-weight-black">Story time :)</h3>
          <p class="subheading">
            Nearly a year ago, I began my journey as a developer.
            I've mainly contributed to different projects (most of them free and open source), 
            worked on small webapps
            for clients, and collaborated with very awesome and talented people to
            create, design, and expand applications that help people and impact their
            lives.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading font-weight-black">Characteristics</h3>
          <p class="subheading">
            In general I am usually down to earth or "chill" guy, constantly curious, and committed into
            improving myself as person and as a developer. I really enjoy building things in general
            and seeing projects, ideas, plans come to life. Working with others, hearing them out, and
            stepping up is one of the main things I am confident about myself. Above all else, I like to
            keep myself humble.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading font-weight-black">Problem solving!</h3>
          <p class="subheading">
            Some of the things I really enjoy doing is brainstorming and finding practical solutions to problems,
            I'm a simple person and I like keeping things simple so that the people around me can easily understand
            and come up with ways to solve problems and create solutions. I learn ideas and concepts pretty fast too.
          </p>
